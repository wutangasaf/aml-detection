## IMPLICATIONS FOR CNA SYSTEM

### Key Detection Capabilities Needed

1. **Narrative Coherence Analysis**
   - Does customer's stated business match transaction patterns?
   - Are source of funds claims consistent with observed behavior?
   - Do account activities align with customer profile over time?

2. **Red Flag Pattern Recognition**
   - Unusual account opening patterns (multiple accounts, quick succession)
   - Transactions inconsistent with stated purpose
   - Layering patterns (rapid movement, small amounts, many accounts)
   - Structuring (just-under-threshold transactions)

3. **Network Analysis**
   - Connections between seemingly unrelated accounts
   - Shared identifiers (phones, emails, addresses)
   - Transaction flows between high-risk entities

4. **Temporal Analysis**
   - Evolution of customer behavior over time
   - Sudden changes in transaction patterns
   - Dormant account reactivation

5. **Cross-Reference Checking**
   - Consistency between customer statements and external data
   - Verification of business legitimacy
   - Screening against sanctions/PEP lists

## REGULATORY TRENDS

1. **Individual Accountability**: Regulators increasingly holding individuals responsible
2. **Effectiveness Over Compliance**: Focus on outcome-based assessment
3. **Technology Expectations**: Regulators expect modern, effective monitoring
4. **Fintech Scrutiny**: Digital banks face heightened oversight
5. **Proactive Disclosure**: Expectation of self-reporting issues
6. **Culture Assessment**: Focus on compliance culture, not just processes
